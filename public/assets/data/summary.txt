Hi, I'm Alex. I've been a professional software developer for 7 years, and began as a hobbyist in 2001.
I'm a self-starter and quick learner when it comes to new technologies and challenges.
My professional experience includes websites, command line, desktop, and mobile applications.

I work well in teams and independently, and will be a great asset to your team.
My experience in a wide number of technologies and diverse fields makes me a great problem solver.
I'm not afraid of learning the right language or tool to solve a problem the right way.
